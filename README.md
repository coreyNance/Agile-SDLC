## Question One
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

     To try and interpret their needs is to first listen to what the user is trying to get out of the program.  With listening to what the user wants, how they want to see it, and where they want to see it gives you the vital info that will help form the user stories.  Once you have the user stories, then you can see which of the criteria is depended on the other and which story will bring value to the user the soonest.  This step will then set the pace for the project as well as help create the product backlog. 

## Question Two

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

     Before I learned about agile and user stories, I approached a program by just starting to write the code and being stalled mainly due to not having any direction.  Now with learning agile, I look at the requriments for the code or what wants and needs of the user and create epics based off that info.  Next I divide an epic down into smaller user stories that I can then use to achieve the goal of done.  The main part of agile I want to incorporate is being able to create and maximaze my time during a sprint so that I could achieve the most value and efficency from that.

## Question Three
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

     A team has to be able to work together.  I would say a good team memeber has to be able to think about others, maybe even more than themselves.  Being humble is a great quality as well.  Even you feel that your the best programmer on your team, that doesnt add any value if you feel that you have to make that known.  A great programmer is one that can be a motivator for their entire team to succeed and work at the highest level of efficientcy.  I guess to try and say it correctly is that a great team memeber is one who not only tries to motivate him self at the highest possible level, they also motivate others around them to also be at that same level.
